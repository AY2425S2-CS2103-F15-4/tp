--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.5).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TAssist.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TAssist.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add -n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -m A0123456J -t T01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to TAssist.

   * `edit -i 1 -p 91234567 -e johndoe@example.com` : Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

   * `tag -a -i 1 -tag lateStudent` : Adds a tag to the 1st student with the label `lateStudent`
   
   * `del -i 3` : Deletes the contact at index 3.
   
   * `export -f ./data/test.csv` Exports the current data as a CSV file into the path ./data/test.csv

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Tired of using the user guide to understand how to use? Just type the command name (e.g. `edit`) into the command box to know more about how to use the command!

1. Student particulars that you would not require on a regular basis can be hidden! Simply type `toggle` and they will disappear! Alternatively click on `view` → `Compact View`! <br>
   ![UiToggle](images/UiToggle.png)

1. To show more details about a particular contact, click on the contact itself!<br>

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add -n John Doe`.

* Items in parentheses requires at least one of them to be supplied.<br>
  e.g `(-p PHONE_NUMBER -tg TELEGRAM_HANDLE)` means either `-p PHONE_NUMBER` or `-tg TELEGRAM_HANDLE` or both `-p PHONE_NUMBER -tg TELEGRAM HANDLE` are accepted.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `-n NAME [-tag TAG]` can be used as `-n John Doe -tag friend` or as `-n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-tag TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Toggling view : `toggle`

Toggles the student record view to be more compact.
The following particulars of a student will be hidden if compact view is enabled where applicable: `PHONE_NUMBER`, `TELEGRAM_HANDLE`, `EMAIL`, `MATRICULATION_NUMBER`, `YEAR` and `FACULTY`.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** `PHONE_NUMBER` AND `TELEGRAM_HANDLE` can be copied to your clipboard! Just click on it!
  </box>

### Listing all students : `list`

Shows a list of all students in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Searching students: `search`

Search for students based on parameters.

Format: `search [OPTIONS]`

Examples:
* `search -n john` returns `john` and `John Doe`

### Redo command: `redo`
Format: `redo`

Redo the last command that was executed.
Refer to **Undo Command** for the list of commands supported.

<box type="tip" seamless>
Tip: if you undo a command and run any other **valid** commands
(including ignored command such as `list`), you will not be able to redo
any of the old commands that you had just undo.
<box/>
* Example:
    1. Run a command `lab -ln 1 -msc 25`
    2. `undo` (undo the command `lab -ln 1 -msc 25`)
    3. Here you can still redo the command, but if you run something step 4:
    4. `list` or `att -i 1 -w 3`
    5. You cannot redo the `lab -ln 1 -msc 25` command

### Undo command: `undo`
Format: `undo`

Undo the last command that was executed.

Supported commands:
* `add`
* `edit`
* `delete`
* `clear`
* `att`
* `lab`
* `tag`

The following commands will ignore any changes:
* `list`
* `exit`
* `help`
* `toggle`
* `search`
    * Note: run the list command to see any updated changes to student's information if you any more commands.
* `export`
* `load`

### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to the address book.

Format: `add -n NAME (-p PHONE_NUMBER -tg TELEGRAM_HANDLE) -e EMAIL -m MATRICULATION_NUMBER (-t TUTORIAL_GROUP -b LAB_GROUP) [-f FACULTY] [-y YEAR_OF_STUDY] [-r REMARKS] [-tag TAG]…​`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Matriculation numbers follows a checksum rule!
See [here](https://nusmodifications.github.io/nus-matriculation-number-calculator/) for a matriculation number calculator.

Want to manually calculate the checksum?
1. Sum up only the **last 6 numbers** within the matriculation number.
1. Divide this sum by 13 and take the remainder.
1. Use the remainder as an index (0-based!) to select a character from the sequence `YXWURNMLJHEADB`.
- `A0000000Y` has a sum of `0` and thus ends with `Y`.
- `A4000049Y` has a sum of `13` and thus also ends with `Y`.
- `A0000001X` has a sum of `1` and thus ends with `X`.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Only the **matriculation number** of a record makes them unique!
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A student can have any number of tags (including 0).
Tags must be a single word consisting of alphanumeric characters only.
Tags also have a limit of 60 characters.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:** 
* If `TUTORIAL_GROUP` is provided as an input when adding a student, then the student is assigned 
the Default Attendance List (with No Tutorial for Weeks 1 and 2, and Not Attended for Weeks 3 to 13). 
* If no `TUTORIAL_GROUP` is provided as input when adding a student, then the student is assigned
a Blank Attendance List.
</box>

Examples:
* `add -n John -p 81234567 -tg @jornn -e e1234567@u.nus.edu -m A1234567X -t T02 -b B03 -f Computing -y 5 -r Likes to sing`
* `add -n Doe -tg @doe_a_deer -e e7654321@u.nus.edu -b B01 -m A7654321J`

### Editing a student : `edit`

There are 2 possible ways to edit the students in the list.

#### 1. Edit a single student

Edits an existing student in the address book.

Format: `edit -i INDEX [-n NAME] [-p PHONE_NUMBER] [-tg TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [-e EMAIL] [-m MATRICULATION_NUMBER] [-t TUTORIAL_GROUP] [-b LAB_GROUP] [-f FACULTY] [-y YEAR_OF_STUDY] [-r REMARKS]​`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* The behaviour of the edit command depends on the field being edited:
  * For mandatory fields of a student: `-n NAME`, `-e EMAIL`, `-m MATRICULATION_NUMBER`, a valid input value must be provided.
to replace the current value. 
    * E.g. `edit -i 1 -n Alex` is valid, editing the name of student of index 1 to Alex.
    * `edit -i 1 -n 123!#$` is invalid, because 123!#$ is not a valid name.
    * `edit -i 1 -n` is invalid, because a student must have a name, which is a mandatory field.
  * There are two sets of conditional fields: Set 1: `-p PHONE_NUMBER -tg TELEGRAM_HANDLE` and 
  * Set 2: `-t TUTORIAL_GROUP -b LAB_GROUP`.
These are conditional fields, whereby AT LEAST ONE or BOTH of the fields in EVERY SET must have a valid input.
    * Providing a valid input value for either or both fields will always be supported as a valid edit.
    * The validity of the edit command depends on whether the student fulfills these conditions after the edit:
      * After the edit, the student has AT LEAST a valid `PHONE_NUMBER` OR a valid `TELEGRAM_HANDLE`.
      * After the edit, the student has AT LEAST a valid `TUTORIAL_GROUP` OR a valid `LAB_GROUP`.
    * E.g. if the student of index 1 currently has a valid `PHONE_NUMBER` but no valid `TELEGRAM_HANDLE`:
      * `edit -i 1 -p 90001234` is valid, because he will still have a valid phone number after the edit.
      * `edit -i 1 -t @telehandle123` is valid, because he will have BOTH a valid phone number 
      AND a valid teleHandle after the edit.
      * `edit -i 1 -p` is INVALID, because the proposed edit would make the student have NEITHER a valid phone number,
      NOR a valid teleHandle after the edit.
  * Optional fields like `FACULTY`, `YEAR` and `REMARKS` can be edited to any valid input, or empty input.

Examples:
*  `edit -i 1 -p 91234567 -e johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit -i 2 -n Betsy Crower` Edits the name of the 2nd student to be `Betsy Crower`.

#### 2. Edit multiple students (Batch edit)

Edits several existing student in the address book in one go.

Format: `edit -i INDEX_RANGE [-t TUTORIAL_GROUP] [-b LAB_GROUP] [-f FACULTY] [-y YEAR_OF_STUDY]`
* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX_RANGE`. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided. (Only the 4 stated here can be edited. Any other fields will not be accepted.)
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:
* `edit -i 1-3 -y 2` Edits the year of study for the 1st to 3rd students to be 2
* `edit -i 1, 4, 5 -y 2 -f SOC` Edits the year of study for the 1st, 4th and 5th students to be 2 and faculty to be SOC


<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:**
* The behaviour of editing a `TUTORIAL_GROUP` on the student's Attendance List depends on his original and updated
  status (whether he had a tutorial group before the edit, and will have one after the edit).
    * Case 1: A student originally has a valid `TUTORIAL_GROUP` (and hence a valid Attendance List),
        * Case 1.1: An edit command is given to edit his `TUTORIAL_GROUP` to another valid `TUTORIAL_GROUP`.
          Then the student's Attendance List is carried over (No change to the Attendance List).
        * Case 1.2: An edit command is given to edit his `TUTORIAL_GROUP` to an empty input.
          Provided the aforementioned restrictions on the conditional parameters are fulfilled (i.e. the student has a valid `LAB_GROUP`),
          then the student's Attendance List is cleared and replaced with the Blank Attendance List.
    * Case 2: A student originally has NO valid `TUTORIAL_GROUP` (and hence an empty Attendance List),
        * Case 2.1: An edit command is given to edit his `TUTORIAL_GROUP` to a valid `TUTORIAL_GROUP`.
          Then the student's Attendance List is set to the Default Attendance List
          (with No Tutorial for Weeks 1 and 2, and Not Attended for Weeks 3 to 13).
        * Case 2.2: An edit command is given to edit his `TUTORIAL_GROUP` to an empty input.
          Then the student's Attendance List remains as a Blank Attendance List.
</box>

### Deleting a student : `del`
Deletes the specified student from the address book.

Format: `del -i INDEX[,INDEX or RANGE]...`

Parameters:
* -i: Specifies the 1-based index(es) of the person(s) to delete. Accepts:
* Single index (e.g. 1)
* Multiple indices separated by commas (e.g. 1,3,5)
* Ranges using dashes (e.g. 2-4)
* Mixed usage (e.g. 1,3-5,7)

Restrictions:
* The index must be a positive non-zero integer.
* Index ranges must be valid (e.g., 2-1 is not allowed).
* The -i prefix must be provided only once. Multiple -i prefixes (e.g. -i 1 -i 2) are not allowed.

Examples:
* `del -i 2`
* Deletes the person at index 2.
* `del -i 1,3-5,7`
* Deletes persons at indices 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Tagging a student: `tag`

There are 3 ways to tag a student.

#### 1. Adding tags

Adds tag(s) to a student.

Format: `tag -a -i INDEX [-tag TAG_NAME]...`

* Adds tags to the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* You need to add at least 1 tag. The tag will be added on top of the current tags the student has.
* The `TAG_NAME` must be alphanumeric and have a maximum of 60 characters.
* This is purely for adding. To edit and delete tags, look at [Edit Tags](#2-editing-a-tag) and [Delete Tags](#3-deleting-tags)

Examples:
* `tag -a -i 1 -tag lateStudent` Adds a tag to the 1st student with the label `lateStudent`
* `tag -a -i 1 -tag NeedHelp -tag AbleToCompete` Adds a tag to the 1st student with the labels `NeedHelp` and `AbleToCompete`
  * The resultant tags will be sorted alphabetically.

#### 2. Editing a tag

Edits a current tag.

Format: `tag -m -i INDEX -tag OLD_TAG_NAME -tag NEW_TAG_NAME`

* Edits the tag `OLD_TAG_NAME` and replaces the tags value with `NEW_TAG_NAME` of the student at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* You can only edit 1 tag at a time. The OLD_TAG_NAME must exist for you to edit and replace its value.
* The `OLD_TAG_NAME` and `NEW_TAG_NAME` must be alphanumeric and have a maximum of 60 characters.

Examples:
* `tag -m -i 1 -tag lastStudent -tag earlyStudent` Replaces the value of the `lateStudent` tag, of the 1st student, with `earlyStudent`
* `tag -m -i 1 -tag NeedHelp -tag CanSurvive` Replaces the value of the `NeedHelp` tag, of the 1st student, with `CanSurvive`

#### 3. Deleting tags

Removes tag(s) from a student.

Format `tag -d -i INDEX [-tag TAG_NAME]...`

* Deletes the specified tags from the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* You must specify at least 1 tag when using this command. `TAG_NAME` is case sensitive and will only delete exact matches.
* The `TAG_NAME` must be alphanumeric and have a maximum of 60 characters.

Examples:
* `tag -d -i 1 -tag earlyStudent` Deletes the tag `earlyStudent` from student 1
* `tag -d -i 1 -tag tag1 -tag tag2` Deletes the tags `tag1` and `tag2` from student 1

### Marks attendance: `att`

Marks the attendance of an individual student, or a tutorial group.

<box type="tip" seamless>
**Tip**: With the new release, you can now mark the attendance of multiple students or tutorial groups.
</box>

Format: `att (-i INDEX -t TUTORIAL_GROUP) -w WEEK [-mc] [-u] [-nt]`

* Conditional parameters: EITHER `-i INDEX` OR `-t TUTORIAL_GROUP`
  * Not accepted: NEITHER of the flags provided, or BOTH flags provided together.
* Mandatory parameter: `-w WEEK`
  * Not accepted: MISSING week flag
* Optional parameters: EITHER ONE OF `-mc`, `-u`, OR `-nt`
  * Not accepted: TWO or more of the above flags.

Assuming the restrictions are satisfied,
* Marks the attendance of a student (if `-i INDEX` is provided)
  OR all students in a tutorial group (if `-t TUTORIAL_GROUP` is provided).
* The new attendance status is ATTENDED by default. However:
    * If `-mc` is provided, new attendance status is ON MC.
    * If `-u` is provided, new attendance status is NOT ATTENDED.
    * If `-nt` is provided, new attendance status is NO TUTORIAL.

* **Note**: Additional restrictions apply on the marking attendance command.
  * Commands using the `-i` flag have additional restrictions.
    1. `-nt` flag cannot be used on a command with the `-i` flag. This means you cannot mark an individual
    as having No Tutorial.
       * If Alex of index 1 didn't attend Week 5 tutorial, mark him as Not Attended (or Unattended) using `att -i -w 5 -u`.
       * If Alex's tutorial group T01 falls on a public holiday, such that the Week 5 tutorial gets cancelled,
       mark the whole tutorial group as No Tutorial. Use the command `att -t T01 -w 5 -nt`.
    2. If the student specified by the `INDEX` has No Tutorial in the given week, the command is invalid. 
    This means you cannot mark an individual to any attendance status, if he currently has No Tutorial.
       * Assume Alex of tutorial group T01 originally had their tutorial cancelled due to the public holiday.
       Now, the profs announce a make-up tutorial for T01 that everyone must attend (like normal tutorials).
           * First, mark the whole tutorial group as Not Attended, using `att -t T01 -w 5 -u`.
           * On the day of the makeup tutorial, you find that Alex (index 1) attended.
           * Then, mark Alex as having attended the tutorial, `att -i 1 -w 5`.
    3. If the student has a Blank Attendance List, any command on the student will be invalid.
       * Alex of index 1 has no `TUTORIAL_GROUP` (e.g. he is not in your tutorial group).
       Then it doesn't make sense to mark his attendance for any week.
       * If you realise Alex is actually in tutorial group T01, use the `edit` command to edit
       his `TUTORIAL_GROUP` to T01 first. Then you can use the mark attendance command on him.

* **Note**: You can now mark the attendance of multiple students and tutorial groups as valid.
  However, do note that if you are using the `-i` flag, to mark attendance of students by index,
  the restrictions aforementioned apply to EVERY student listed.
    * For example, you want to mark students of index 1 to 10 (inclusive) as attended for week 3.
        * You realise that student 3 has no tutorial group, and students 4,5 are in tutorial group T03,
          and group T03's tutorial has been cancelled due to the clashing holiday. They are currently
          marked as No Tutorial for week 3, which is appropriate given their tutorial is cancelled.
        * `att -i 1-10 -w 3` gives you an error because students 3, 4, 5 do not fulfill the restrictions.
        * You will need to mark attendance for the other people using `att -i 1-2,6-10 -w 3`.


Examples:
* `att -i 1 -w 3` marks the first student as attended Tutorial Week 3.
* `att -i 2 -w 10 -mc` marks the second student as on MC for Tutorial Week 10.
* `att -t T01 -w 1 -nt` marks the whole tutorial group T01 as No Tutorial for Tutorial Week 1.
  * This means each student in tutorial group T01 has his attendance updated to No Tutorial.
* `att -i 1-5 -w 3` marks the students of indexes 1 to 5 (inclusive) of week 3 as Attended

### Updating lab scores: `lab`
Updates the lab score for the specified student, or update the maximum score for the specified lab.

Format: `lab (-i [INDEX]) -ln [LAB_NUMBER] -sc [NEW_SCORE] -msc [MAXIMUM_LAB_SCORE]`

3 ways of using this command
1. Update lab score: Updates the student `INDEX` lab `LAB_NUMBER` score to be `NEW_SCORE`.
    * Command format: `lab -i [INDEX] -ln [LAB_NUMBER] -sc [NEW_SCORE]`.
2. Update maximum lab score: Updates the lab `LAB_NUMBER` maximum score to be `NEW_SCORE`.
    * Command format: `lab (-i [INDEX]) -ln [LAB_NUMBER] -msc [NEW_SCORE]`.
    * Note that the `-i` flag is optional here as it will be ignored.
3. Update both lab score and max lab score: Updates the student `INDEX` lab `LAB_NUMBER` score to be `NEW_SCORE_1`
   and at the same time update lab `LAB_NUMBER` maximum score to be `NEW_SCORE_2`.
    * Command format: `lab -i [INDEX] -ln [LAB_NUMBER] -sc [NEW_SCORE_1] -msc [NEW_SCORE_2]`.

Note that for all cases, it the flags does not need to be in this specific order.

### Load Data : `load`

Imports student data from an existing `.csv` or `.json` file.

Format: `load -f FILE_NAME -ext FILE_EXTENSION`

* The `FILE_NAME` should not include a file extension or path. It must refer to a file in the `/data` folder, e.g. `userdata`.
* The `FILE_EXTENSION` must be either `csv` or `json`.
* The file must follow TAssist's expected format. Invalid or malformed data will be rejected with a warning.
* Duplicate or unparseable records will be skipped with error messages shown.

Examples:
* `load -f userdata -ext csv` loads a CSV file named `userdata.csv` located in the `/data` folder.
* `load -f students -ext json` loads a JSON file named `students.json` in the `/data` folder.

### Export Data : `export`

Exports all the student data as CSV or JSON file.
There are 2 ways to export data

#### 1. Using the CLI:

Format: `export -f FILE_PATH`

* Exports the data to the `FILE_PATH` specified in this command.
* The `FILE_PATH` can either be relative to the current application OR be a full file path.
* The FILE_PATH must end either in a `<filename>.csv` or `<filename>.json`

Examples:
* `export -f ./data/test.csv` Exports the current data as a CSV file into the path ./data/test.csv
* `export -f /Users/user_name/Desktop/data.json` Exports the current data as a JSON file into the Desktop under data.json

#### 2. Using the UI:

1. On the toolbar, go to Files > Export Data...
2. Select the file type (either JSON or CSV)
3. Select where you want to save your file at

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
